Use floats or inline-block in your CSS to achieve a two-column layout
  -Good!

Use the correct Open Sans Google Font typeface to style the text denoted in the design file and according to the JPEG provided
  -Good!

Use proper filename conventions (lowercase, .html)
  -Good!

Use an external CSS stylesheet to style your page
  -Good!

Make sure that all images are no wider than their containers
  -Good!

Add a hover effect to all the links using pseudo-classes
  -Good!
  This is more of a nitpicky design thing, but the yellow background hover doesn't look as good on the top nav items (since they are already yellow). You could either pick a different color, or give those nav items a different hover color. But code wise, well done!

Integrate drop caps using pseudo-classes
  -Nice! These look great.


Additional Comments:

Nicole, this is looking really good! You're definitely getting the hang of this stuff. If you have time, try adding the footer too. Let me know if you have any questions.
